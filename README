A collection of POSIX shell scripts to initialize iptables and
net-related sysctl variables of Linux.

These POSIX scripts set some typical iptables commands for a dialup PC,
optionally including a simple portknocking solution and router functionality.
The usage is somewhat similar to SuSEfirewall2, but the approach has
some essential differences. In particular, packets are usually not DROPed but
REJECTed until a rate-limit is reached. It is not necessary to restart the
firewall after a connection is established. The setting of the kernel variables
is done with a separate script. Currently, IPv6 is not supported by the script.

To install this project, copy the scripts into your path.
firewall.config can also be copied into your /etc directory.

Before you run firewall, please edit firewall.config to your needs.

The firewall script reads your firewall.config and then
(by default) runs sysctl.net and initializes iptables according
to the content of firewall.config.

sysctl.net initializes some net-related Linux sysctl variables.

To get help, run firewall -h or sysctl.net -h, respectively.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
