A collection of POSIX shell scripts to initialize iptables and
net-related sysctl variables of Linux.

These POSIX scripts set some typical iptables commands for a dialup PC,
optionally including a simple portknocking solution and router functionality.
The usage is somewhat similar to SuSEfirewall2, but the approach has
some essential differences. In particular, packets are usually not DROPed but
REJECTed until a rate-limit is reached. It is not necessary to restart the
firewall after a connection is established. The setting of the kernel variables
is done with a separate script. Currently, IPv6 is not supported by the script.

To install this project, copy the scripts into your path.
firewall.config can also be copied into your /etc directory.

You also need push.sh from http://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.

Before you run firewall, please edit firewall.config to your needs.

The firewall script reads your firewall.config and then
(by default) runs sysctl.net and initializes iptables according
to the content of firewall.config.

sysctl.net initializes some net-related Linux sysctl variables.

To get help, run firewall -h or sysctl.net -h, respectively.

For openrc (the Gentoo init system) there are some scripts provided in
the openrc folder. Copy these scripts and their configs to /etc/init.d
or /etc/conf.d, respectively and edit /etc/conf.d.
To activate the firewall with openrc, call e.g.
(the runlevels might depend on your configuration):
	rc-config add fireclose boot
	rc-config add firewall default
Instead of adding fireclose to your boot runlevel, you might also want to
add to your relevant /etc/conf.d/net* file(s):
rc_need="fireclose"

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman)
which installs all files (but you still have to configure them).
